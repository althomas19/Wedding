- question: "What is the dress code and will the wedding evening take place indoors or outdoors?"
  answer: "We are asking guests to dress in formal attire; we encourage floor or ankle-length dresses, dressy separates, and darker-hued suits. We can’t wait to celebrate with you in style!  Weather permitting, the ceremony and cocktail hour will take place outside in the gardens, dinner will be served in a large tent, and our reception will be on The Mount’s covered terrace. Guests will walk or be shuttled down a short gravel road to the ceremony and during cocktail hour, guests can feel free to walk around The Mount’s gardens and property. In the Berkshires area, October temperatures are normally in the mid-50s or low-60s. Please choose your outfit and footwear with this in mind!" 

- question: "What time should I arrive?"
  answer: "Please plan to arrive at The Mount by 4:00 PM to find your seat before our ceremony begins at 4:30 PM."

- question: "Are children welcome?"
  answer: "We kindly request that our wedding ceremony and reception be an adults-only occasion. Little ones are welcome to join our other wedding weekend events, including our Welcome Party on Friday and Brunch on Sunday. Babysitters and babysitting service recommendations will be provided - please reach out to Gillian and Alex for more information."

- question: "Can I bring a plus-one?"
  answer: "Due to limited space, we are only able to accommodate guests formally invited on your invitation. If your invitation includes a plus-one, their name will be listed."

- question: "When is the RSVP deadline?"
  answer: "We will be collecting RSVPs when our formal invitations are sent. Please reach out to Gillian and Alex if you know you will not be able to attend."

- question: "Will there be transportation provided?"
  answer: "We will provide a shuttle for guests, making stops at all of the hotels at which we have blocks reserved. The shuttle will take guests to The Mount and will return guests to those same hotels or to our After Party location. For those guests who choose to drive (or are not staying in hotel blocks), The Mount’s parking lot can accommodate parking for all of our guests. Please note the parking lot is approximately ¼ mile from the main house. We will provide a shuttle bus from the parking lot to the main house for guests who do not choose to walk. More information on shuttles will be provided closer to our wedding weekend."
